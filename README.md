# Nand2tetris
It is a exercise project for the famous [Nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) project to implement project by myself.
During this period, I have spent more than 4 mouths to finish and improve all projects, and it taught me a lot of basic but funny things.
The shining part of this project is that I use the c++ language to build the whole complier system, which is indeed a challenge for me.
Anyway, I wish it could help anyone who want to learn Nand2tetris by itself.
