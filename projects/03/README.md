# Notes

## Important concept
- Sequential chips(Data Flip-flop)
- Register
- Memory

## What we need do:
- Write the HDL code for simulating the register chip, the memory chip and the counter chip.

## The things we need to care:
- The most important part is the sequential chips link the chips' output with the time. It is wired when you try to understand it using the old perspective. So, it is a good idea to watch the output change on simulator.
