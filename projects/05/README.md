# Notes

## Important concept
- CPU
- Memory
- Computer

## What we need do:
- Write the HDL code for simulating the CPU chip, the memory chip, the computer chip.

## The things we need to care:
- "No such built-in chip used:RAM16K": it means you should use the RAM16K chip to build the memory chip. At the beginning, I try to create the RAM8K chip and use it. In the memory test, it is absolutely right, but it can't pass the computer test.
